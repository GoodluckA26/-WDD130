                <h2> History</h2>
                <p class="history-p">White Water Company was established in 2005 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who
                    shared a passion for white water rafting.
                    What started as a small operation with just a few rafts and guides has grown into a well-respected
                    company known for its commitment to safety, quality, and environmental stewardship.
                    Over the years, we have expanded our offerings to include trips on various rivers, catering to
                    different skill levels and interests.
                    Our dedication to providing exceptional experiences has earned us numerous awards and a loyal
                    customer base that continues to grow.</p>
